LSTMs overcame the vanishing gradients problem in RNN and this resulted in amazing results in speech to text conversion and the advancement of Siri, Cortana, Google voice assistant, Alexa etc. 
They also improved machine translation, which resulted in the ability to translate documents into different languages, translate images into text, text into images, and captioning video etc.
